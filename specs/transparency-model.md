# GFC Transparency Model

This document describes how German Foundation Coin (GFC) approaches transparency
in a practical, technical, and verifiable way.

Transparency is treated as infrastructure, not as a marketing concept.

## 1. Problem Statement

In many charitable and impact-driven initiatives, transparency relies on trust-based
reporting, delayed disclosures, or selectively published information.

This creates several systemic issues:
- Donors cannot independently verify fund flows.
- Reporting is often delayed, incomplete, or difficult to compare.
- Accountability depends on centralized actors and good intentions.

GFC is designed to reduce these trust dependencies by shifting transparency
towards on-chain verifiability and publicly documented processes.

## 2. Core Principles

GFC follows a small set of non-negotiable transparency principles:

1. **Verifiability over promises**  
   Any relevant fund movement should be traceable on-chain or through
   publicly auditable contracts.

2. **Process documentation over narratives**  
   How decisions are made is more important than how they are presented.

3. **Delayed discretion, not delayed disclosure**  
   Where discretion is necessary (e.g. timing, execution), disclosure
   must follow in a predictable and documented manner.

4. **Separation of roles**  
   Operational control, custody, and verification should not be concentrated
   in a single entity.

---

## 3. On-Chain Components

The transparency model relies on several on-chain building blocks:

- **Token contract**  
  Public supply, distribution, and transfer rules.

- **Lock and vesting contracts**  
  Long-term commitments with enforced time constraints and no unilateral
  early-release mechanisms.

- **Charity and foundation-related wallets**  
  Publicly known addresses with clearly defined roles.

All contract addresses are intended to be published and documented once finalized.

---

## 4. Off-Chain Transparency

Not all processes can or should be fully automated.

For off-chain components, GFC follows these rules:
- Written specifications exist before execution.
- Deviations must be documented.
- Historical records remain publicly accessible.

This includes governance decisions, partner selection, and non-automated
fund distributions.

---

## 5. Limitations

Transparency does not eliminate the need for judgment or responsibility.

GFC does not claim:
- that all decisions can be automated,
- that on-chain data alone provides full context,
- or that transparency removes the need for long-term credibility.

The goal is not perfection, but a measurable reduction of opacity.

## 6. Status

This document describes the intended transparency model.

Implementation details may evolve, but changes are expected to be:
- documented,
- versioned,
- and publicly traceable.
