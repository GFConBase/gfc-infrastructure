# Governance Constraints

This document defines governance-related constraints
for the GFC infrastructure.

Rather than describing governance mechanisms,
it focuses on limitations, safeguards, and boundaries
intended to reduce discretionary risk.

---

## 1. Principle of Explicit Authority

Any entity or role with decision-making authority
must be explicitly documented.

Implicit authority, undocumented control paths,
or informal decision rights are considered out of scope.

---

## 2. Separation of Responsibilities

Operational execution, fund custody,
and verification responsibilities
should not be concentrated in a single role or entity.

Where full separation is not immediately feasible,
transitional arrangements must be documented.

---

## 3. Limited Upgrade and Control Scope

Contracts and systems are designed to minimize
the scope of unilateral changes.

Upgrade paths, if any, must be:
- explicitly defined,
- technically constrained,
- and publicly documented.

---

## 4. Predictable Exception Handling

Exceptional actions (e.g. emergency interventions)
are not treated as normal operations.

If exceptions are required:
- their scope must be limited,
- their execution documented,
- and their rationale publicly explained after the fact.

---

## 5. No Implicit Governance by Token Ownership

Token ownership alone does not grant
implicit governance authority over infrastructure,
fund allocation, or operational decisions.

Governance powers, where applicable,
are defined explicitly and independently.

---

## Status

This document defines governance boundaries
and constraints at a conceptual level.

Specific governance mechanisms may evolve,
but are expected to remain within
the constraints described here.
