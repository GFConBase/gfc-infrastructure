# Non-Goals
**Status:** Stable

This document defines what the GFC infrastructure is intentionally not designed to do.

Defining non-goals is an essential part of system design, as it prevents misaligned expectations and scope creep.

## 1. No Short-Term Speculation Focus
GFC does not aim to optimize for short-term price movements, trading volume, or speculative incentives.

The infrastructure prioritizes long-term accountability over market-driven dynamics.

## 2. No Anonymous or Unverifiable Fund Flows
GFC does not support opaque fund routing, undocumented wallet usage, or discretionary transfers without verifiable records.

Any process that cannot be documented or reviewed is considered out of scope.

## 3. No Fully Automated Governance Claims
While automation is used where appropriate, GFC does not claim that all governance decisions can or should be fully automated.

Human oversight, documented discretion, and clear responsibility boundaries are intentionally preserved.

## 4. No Marketing-Driven Architecture
The infrastructure is not designed around viral mechanics, incentive loops, or growth-optimized token behavior.

System design decisions are not made to support marketing narratives.

## 5. No Promise of Impact Guarantees
GFC does not claim that technical transparency alone guarantees social impact.

The infrastructure provides tools for accountability, not assurances of outcomes.

## Status Notes
This document defines intentional boundaries.

Non-goals may be refined over time, but are expected to remain stable in principle.
