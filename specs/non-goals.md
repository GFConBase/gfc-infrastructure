# Non-Goals

This document outlines what the GFC infrastructure is intentionally
*not* designed to do.

Defining non-goals is considered an essential part of system design,
as it helps prevent misaligned expectations and scope creep.

---

## 1. No Short-Term Speculation Focus

GFC is not designed to optimize for short-term price movements,
trading volume, or speculative incentives.

The infrastructure prioritizes long-term accountability
over market-driven dynamics.

---

## 2. No Anonymous or Unverifiable Fund Flows

GFC does not aim to support opaque fund routing,
undocumented wallet usage, or discretionary transfers
without verifiable records.

Any process that cannot be documented or reviewed
is considered out of scope.

---

## 3. No Fully Automated Governance Claims

While automation is used where appropriate,
GFC does not claim that all governance decisions
can or should be fully automated.

Human oversight, documented discretion,
and clear responsibility boundaries
are intentionally preserved.

---

## 4. No Marketing-Driven Architecture

The infrastructure is not designed around
viral mechanics, incentive loops,
or growth-optimized token behavior.

System design decisions are not made
to support marketing narratives.

---

## 5. No Promise of Impact Guarantees

GFC does not claim that technical transparency
alone guarantees social impact.

The infrastructure provides tools for accountability,
not assurances of outcomes.

---

## Status

This document defines intentional boundaries.
Non-goals may be refined over time,
but are expected to remain stable in principle.
