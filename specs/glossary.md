# Glossary
**Status:** Stable

This glossary defines key terms used across the specifications in this repository.
Terms are defined to ensure clarity, consistency, and shared understanding.

## Core Terms

### GFC (German Foundation Coin)
The token and associated infrastructure described in this repository.

### Specification (Spec)
A document defining intended behavior, constraints, and boundaries prior to implementation.
Specifications serve as authoritative references and take precedence over implementations and informal statements.

### On-chain
State, logic, or transactions recorded on a blockchain and independently verifiable.

### Off-chain
Processes or decisions not executed on-chain, but constrained by written specifications and intended to be documented in a predictable and reviewable way.

## Presale Terms

### Presale
A time-bound sale process intended to distribute tokens under predefined and documented rules.

### Fixed Price
A constant token price defined by the presale design.
Frontend conversions may be used for display or payment calculation purposes only.

### Instant Distribution
Token transfer to the buyer at the time of purchase, with no later claim phase.

### Softcap
A minimum threshold that determines whether the presale is considered successful.

### Refund
Return of contributed funds to participants under predefined conditions, such as the softcap not being reached by the presale end.

### Withdrawal
The movement of collected presale funds out of the presale contract under predefined and rule-bound conditions.
Withdrawals are a technical mechanism and do not imply discretionary governance authority.

### Unsold Tokens
Tokens allocated to the presale that are not purchased.
Their handling must follow predefined and documented rules.

## Governance Terms

### Governance
Decision-making processes and authority boundaries related to infrastructure operation and fund flows.

### Constraint
A limitation that reduces discretionary control, narrows possible actions, and improves predictability.

### Safeguard
A rule, process, or mechanism intended to prevent misuse, reduce risk, or enforce accountability.

### Multisig (Multi-signature Wallet)
A wallet requiring multiple independent approvals to execute transactions.

## Status Notes
This glossary may be expanded as specifications evolve.

Definitions are intended to remain stable unless explicitly revised through documented updates.
