# GFC Infrastructure

This repository contains core contracts and documentation
for the German Foundation Coin (GFC) transparency infrastructure.

## Focus

- Verifiable fund flows
- Long-term governance
- Public accountability

This repository is intentionally minimal at this stage.
Specifications are published before implementation and
expanded incrementally over time.
