# GFC Infrastructure

This repository contains core contracts and documentation for the
German Foundation Coin (GFC) transparency infrastructure.

Focus:
- verifiable fund flows
- long-term governance
- public accountability

This repository is intentionally minimal at this stage.
Specifications and implementations will be added incrementally.

No marketing. No hype. Long-term only.
